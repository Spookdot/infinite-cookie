# infinite-cookie
A cookie jar providing you with an infinite amount of cookies

## How to use
To make a usable Jar of this project you need to add your own Unsplash Access Key as I am not allowed to distribute my own

Simply replace the empty String in [app/src/org/spook/cookie/App.kt](https://github.com/Spookdot/infinite-cookie/blob/main/app/src/main/kotlin/org/spook/cookie/App.kt) with your own Access Key
and then run
```
gradle shadowJar
```
to get a jar with all required dependencies bundled inside app/build/libs
